# Final Project Rough Draft Notes

## Tasks to complete for the project:
 ### Minimum Viable
    - Hardware
        - Push button based interval timer using ISR
        - Single LED to indicate states
    - Software
        - 3 Mode configuration 
        - logging though Serial out 
### Nice features
    - Hardware
        - LED array 
    - Software
        - Wipe animation
        - PWM on LEDs
        - Additional Modes

### Stretch
    - Stepper Motor and support circuitry
    - Motor contoroller
    - Moisture detection
    - Additional Saftey features and fault handeling

    

## Blocking items
    I don't really have the desire to actually build this device, but I like the idea of portotyping its features.
    There would be a large gap from the software of the interval timer to actually getting power to a wiper blade to have it move correctly.
