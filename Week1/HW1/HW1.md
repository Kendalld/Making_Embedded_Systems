# Laser Route Display

A laser projection system for displaying routes on wall mounted, paper map.

My partner and I love reminicing about previous hikes we have done using a large map we have hanging in our apartment. My idea is to have a laser trace along route on the map that is hanging on the wall. 


## About the project

A laser system will sit mounted on a stage to be hung some distance from the wall where the map is displayed.
Upon input the system will trace the route from beginning to end.
