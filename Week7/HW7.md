Interview Question

Can you tell me an example of a project you started that you couldn't complete physically or technically?
Do you do anything different now when you start projects because of that experience?

Not just giving up mentally or because things got too busy, though that can work if nothing better comes to mind.

Look for process change, and re-evaluation. If floundering press if any pain points with vendors, documentation or tooling. This should help get them talking before bringing back process change. 

Everyone has bit off more than they can chew, retrospection is a gift and helps solidify real world experience.
