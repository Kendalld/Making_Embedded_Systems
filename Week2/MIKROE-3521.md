# The MIKROE-3521

The MIKROE-3521 is a swappable MCU module/daughter card intendend for seating and use in a much larger Motherboard/Dev Kit. <br>
There are little active components on the board, but large male and female mezzanine connectors. <br>

## What kind of processor is it?

[STM32L081CB](https://www.st.com/en/microcontrollers-microprocessors/stm32l081cb.html) <br>

    "Ultra-low-power ARM Cortex-M0+ MCU with 128-Kbytes Flash, 32 MHz CPU, AES" <br>

An M0+ with 128 bit AES encryption capabilities make this a nice choice for cheaper, lower power applications that still need secuirty.

## How much Flash and RAM does it have? Any other memory types?

Flash: 128000 bytes <br>
RAM:    20480 bytes <br>
No other types of memory <br>

## Does it have any special peripherals? (List 3-5 that you find interesting.)

This board does not really have peripherals, but it is interesing: <br>
- The enormous pin count on the mezzinene connectors try and future proof the posibility of a high pin MCU not being pin compatible with the fancy dev kit. <br>
- The silk screen pairs the MCU pin name to it's functions to the dev board.  <br>
    - In this case there are 4 "Microbuses" that take 12 pins each and are repeating. <br>
    - This is done, presumably, to ensure varying MCU module compatability to the mother board by simply repeating the pattern. <br>
        - *Update: I was wrong, there microbus connectors on the motherboard for plug and play periferal hats to the Motherboard also sold at Mikroe* <br>
    - I don't know enough to say for sure, but it feels like this would severly limit the versatility of higher pin count MCUs.  <br>

## If it has an ADC, what are the features?

>A native 12-bit, extended to 16-bit through hardware oversampling, analog-to-digital
>converter is embedded into STM32L081xx device. It has up to 16 external channels and 3
>internal channels (temperature sensor, voltage reference). Three channels, PA0, PA4 and
>PA5, are fast channels, while the others are standard channels.
>The ADC performs conversions in single-shot or scan mode. In scan mode, automatic
>conversion is performed on a selected group of analog inputs.
>The ADC frequency is independent from the CPU frequency, allowing maximum sampling
>rate of 1.14 MSPS even with a low CPU speed. The ADC consumption is low at all
>frequencies (~25 µA at 10 kSPS, ~240 µA at 1MSPS). An auto-shutdown function
>guarantees that the ADC is powered off except during the active conversion phase.
>The ADC can be served by the DMA controller. It can operate from a supply voltage down to
>1.65 V.
>The ADC features a hardware oversampler up to 256 samples, this improves the resolution
>to 16 bits (see AN2668).
>An analog watchdog feature allows very precise monitoring of the converted voltage of one,
>some or all scanned channels. An interrupt is generated when the converted voltage is
>outside the programmed thresholds.
>The events generated by the general-purpose timers (TIMx) can be internally connected to
>the ADC start triggers, to allow the application to synchronize A/D conversions and timers.

- Internal Temperature sensor 
- Internal Volatage reference
- Independence from CPU power and clock makes for lower power or higher speeds as needed
- Hardware oversampeler
- Watchdog for precision, triggering, and security

## Look at one application note for this board.

This looks like a premium ecosystem mostly for proof of conecpt and education. <br>
The MCU can be changed easily to do preferal benchmarking on the exact same hardware setup. <br>
The motherboard has a billion dip switches and buttons that look incredibly cool, but seem a far cry from narrowing in on how a product would look and behave.<br>
